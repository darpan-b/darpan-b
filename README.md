## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Darpan, currently a first year M.Sc. student in Big Data Analytics at RKMVERI, Belur. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from RKMVCC, Rahara.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Nothing as of now. However, I do hope to do some projects on ML / Data Analysis in the recent future.
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
Basics of Data Analytics, Statistics and ML. I hope to gain a firm hold on these by the end of my degree.
<!-- ## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... -->
## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, name it. Since I mostly focused on Theoretical Computer Science during my bachelor's, I'm fairly new to these non-discrete mathematical topics. Any sort of help or advice on these would be appreciated. :)
## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
Competitive Programming (CP), maybe? Though I consider myself retired now, that's pretty much the only thing that I did throughout high school since I was preparing for the informatics olympiad back then, and though not as intensely as before, I did CP till the end of my bachelor's. Although I am not exactly a master at it (pun intented ;) ), I'd consider myself an intermediate CPer, and have a fair bit of experience in it.

## âš¡ Fun fact: ...
I switched to Data Analytics/Data Science because I got tired of Theoretical CS. Nothing against TCS, it's just that I prefer to work on / learn about stuff which is more hands-on / where I can directly see the results of my work, rather than just some abstract ideas on a piece of paper. :)
